Front End - Andrew Dale's Group: Jevon Rambarran, Kenta Hattori, Andrew Dale

We included the Front End, Back End and Unix Shell Scripts that we used which are all in separate folders. 

Everything has already been compiled. The merged transaction file for the daily run is transactions.txt which we concatenated from the transaction files output by the frontend. This is then fed into the backend. To keep the daily script simple I just ran some create transactions, this was also tested with deposit transactions which also works among others.

To check if this works, simply see that the current and master accounts files are empty, they will then be populated by the newly created accounts.
