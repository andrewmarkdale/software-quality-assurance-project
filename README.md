# Software Quality Assurance Project

## Relevant skills: SQA, C++, Java, Bash, Agile and Extreme Programming

## Mock Banking System
This project was carried out in six phases in two different groups. The first group created the frontend in C++ and would handle user input.
The second group created the project backend in Java. The frontend, backend and the system in its entirety were tested using Bash scripts. 
A number of transaction files were created to test the frontend. The frontend would create a daily log and would be passed to the backend 
which would then be run at EoD. Backend was tested to ensure each account was updated accordingly. I then created scripts to test the entire system on a
daily and weekly basis.
