Instructions:

We used Intellij as our IDE of choice for the back end, so you should be able to just open the project on there with no issues. 

We also suggest removing the contents of NewMasterAccounts.txt and initially set the readAccounts to "CurrentBankAccounts.txt.” That way you'll be able to see that the transaction has been applied to the accounts in the NewMasterAccounts.txt file. You’ll notice the difference between CurrentBankAccounts.txt including reduced account balances and a deleted account -- we’ve set the tests up for this phase to simply show ERRORs, disable, transfers and a delete.
